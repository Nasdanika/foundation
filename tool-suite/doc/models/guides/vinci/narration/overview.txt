Hello and welcome to the Nasdanika Vinci Get Started Guide!

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a model of a site using Nasdanika Vinci, and then generating and publishing the site.

We will start with the concepts of model-driven development and Nasdanika Vinci.

Then we will go through the installation process of the Nasdanika Tool Suite, which includes Nasdanika Vinci.

After the installation we will create a modeling project and an initial model.
We will then generate a starter site from the model and publish it to the Internet via GitHub pages.

After that we will populate the model and generate site content from the Eclipse Development Environment User Interface and also using the Nasdanika Command Line Interface.

We will complete the guide with a review and outline of the next steps.
